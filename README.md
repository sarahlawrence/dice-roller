# Dice Roller

## What?

It’s a basic react app that rolls dice for RPGs and let’s you save your commonly used rolls.

## Why?

After several near-death D&D sessions, our existing dice bot was letting us down. The main pain points:

- Confusing syntax for combinations
- Hard to re-roll common actions
- The dice seemed cursed

Now, there’s only so much that can be done about the universe conspiring random seeds against you... but I can certainly do better on the others.

## Is it truely random?

No, but it dogfoods randomness code written by our DM so he can’t complain. Use at the discretion of your individual DM/GM’s approval.

## Other

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
